## Why do we need Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is needed to **orchestrate containers at scale** and make applications **highly available, scalable, and self-healing**.

### What problems it solves

* **Manual operations** → Automates deployment & scheduling
* **Downtime** → Self-healing (restart & reschedule pods)
* **Scaling issues** → Auto & manual scaling
* **Service discovery** → Stable DNS & load balancing
* **Config management** → ConfigMaps & Secrets
* **Risky updates** → Rolling updates & rollbacks
* **Resource misuse** → Requests, limits, QoS

### Interview one-liner

> *Kubernetes manages containers at scale by providing automation, scalability, self-healing, and zero-downtime deployments.*
